        known for his rapid-fire abductive reasoning. He primarily lived with the young
        Iris Wilson, who adapted his exploits with fellow tenants "John H. Wilson" and
        later Ryunosuke Naruhodo into a series of stories collectively known as
        The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes published in The Randst Magazine.
